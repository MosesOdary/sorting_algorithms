Sorting algorithms and Big O notation

General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file

General Learning Objectives

    At least four different sorting algorithms
    What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
    How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
    What is a stable sorting algorithm

Also of Note is to understand the implementation of the following, using C code:

    O(1)
    O(n)
    O(n!)
    n square -> O(n^2)
    log(n) -> O(log(n))
    n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
    n + k -> O(n+k)
    â€¦
